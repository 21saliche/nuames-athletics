      <p>In this class, I learned how to create a website from scratch. At first, I thought that we were going to use templates from online to create a website and the class would be more building a business related. I quickly learned that this was not the case and that we were going to be learning how to use HTML and CSS and Java Script to create different things. I also learned different terms for things like the word hyper links. Which can be links to outside websites or other pages. I didn't know this term before the class. Now, in the future I will be able to use the different skills that I have acquired to build more websites or even create interesting and cool things on the internet. Sololearn was a big help because it taught me how to do each element and I was able to go back and repeat it if I didn't understand.</p>

<h2>Although the other pages have talked about activities, this page will go more in depth.</h2>
<p>In this club we will go to a Utah Jazz game. This game will be a good opportunity for members to have fun and learn what being a true leader is.</p>
<p>Because of the cold weather right now, we will not be able to do very many outdoor activities until spring time.</p>
<p>A lot of our activities will include using the Weber State gym to train and get fit.</p>
<p>Every friday, we will meat after school at 3:00pm in Mrs.Neweys classroom in building D3 before we go anywhere to begin excercing</p>
<p>This way, everyone know what to do and where to go.</p>
<p>Don't forget to sign up for the remind app and get weekly reminders on what we are doing in the club that week</p>
