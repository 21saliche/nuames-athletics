  <div class="a">Sarah Aliche and Angie Mendieta are the creators of this club. Right now, we are both sophmores and intend to keep the club going throughout all three of our highschool years. Because NUAMES does not participate in or have any sports teams, this club was created to give students an opportunity to participate in sports which they love. In this club, we will do many sports (to learn more about what type of sports, visit the activities page). Signing up is easy, just contact the email in the footer below and let them know you want to join. You can also join the remind app.</div></p>

  <div class="b">To join the remind app text: @bbahea to the number: 81010 to join the app. This is also a good club for students to come and make new friends, build teamwork skills, and have fun while getting fit. Not everyone loves to excercise, but this club is perfect for those who do! Feel free to share the remind code with others who you think may want to join the club as well.</div></p>

  <div class="c">We explore many different types of physical activities. Every three weeks, or less depending on how we feel about that particular sport, we will switch sports/activities and try a new one. Each member of the club can vote to which sport they want to play next. There is no deadline to sign up for this club. We will take anyone who decides to join. It is recommended that you sign up as soon as possible so that you don't miss out on any fun events. You also don't want to miss out on getting your t-shirt. If you join the club late, there isn't a guarantee that you will get a fancy t-shirt. For more info on t-shirts and other merchandise, visit the prices page.</div></p>

    <p>In this class, I learned how to create a website from scratch. At first, I thought that we were going to use templates from online to create a website and the class would be more building a business related. I quickly learned that this was not the case and that we were going to be learning how to use HTML and CSS and Java Script to create different things. I also learned different terms for things like the word hyper links. Which can be links to outside websites or other pages. I didn't know this term before the class. Now, in the future I will be able to use the different skills that I have acquired to build more websites or even create interesting and cool things on the internet. Sololearn was a big help because it taught me how to do each element and I was able to go back and repeat it if I didn't understand.</p>
