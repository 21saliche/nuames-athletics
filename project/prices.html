  <p>In this class, I learned how to create a website from scratch. At first, I thought that we were going to use templates from online to create a website and the class would be more building a business related. I quickly learned that this was not the case and that we were going to be learning how to use HTML and CSS and Java Script to create different things. I also learned different terms for things like the word hyper links. Which can be links to outside websites or other pages. I didn't know this term before the class. Now, in the future I will be able to use the different skills that I have acquired to build more websites or even create interesting and cool things on the internet. Sololearn was a big help because it taught me how to do each element and I was able to go back and repeat it if I didn't understand.</p>
